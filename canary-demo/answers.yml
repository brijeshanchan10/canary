# Additional Observations
observations:
  unexpected_behaviors: Promethus query did not work, I did some basic troubleshoot but query retruned 0. I was able to run /metrics api from which I fetched the data. Did some google for Git commands.
  suggested_improvements: Better have option to basic troubleshooting methods in the section.
